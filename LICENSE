You are a data engineer at an e-commerce company. You need to keep data synchronized between different databases/data warehouses as a part of your daily routine. One task that is routinely performed is the sync up of staging data warehouse and production data warehouse. Automating this sync up will save you a lot of time and standardize your process. You will be given a set of python scripts to start with. You will use/modify them to perform the incremental data load from MySQL server which acts as a staging warehouse to the IBM DB2 or PostgreSQL which is a production data warehouse. This script will be scheduled by the data engineers to sync up the data between the staging and production data warehouse
